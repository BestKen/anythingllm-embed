# AnythingLLM Embedded Chat Widget

**This is a submodule of [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) - the all-in-one AI Application**

**Please report any issues or feature requests to the [main repo](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm)**

> [!WARNING]
> The core AnythingLLM team publishes a pre-built version of the script that is bundled
> with the main application. You can find [it in the main repo here.](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/tree/master/frontend/public/embed)
> You should only be working in this repo if you are wanting to build your own custom embed widget for AnythingLLM

This folder of AnythingLLM contains the source code for how the embedded version of AnythingLLM works to provide a public facing interface of your workspace.

The AnythingLLM Embedded chat widget allows you to expose a workspace and its embedded knowledge base as a chat bubble via a `<script>` or `<iframe>` element that you can embed in a website or HTML.

### Security

- Users will _not_ be able to view or read context snippets like they can in the core AnythingLLM application
- Users are assigned a random session ID that they use to persist a chat session.
- **Recommended** You can limit both the number of chats an embedding can process **and** per-session.

_by using the AnythingLLM embedded chat widget you are responsible for securing and configuration of the embed as to not allow excessive chat model abuse of your instance_

### Developer Setup

- `cd embed` from the root of the repo
- `yarn` to install all dev and script dependencies
- `yarn dev` to boot up an example HTML page to use the chat embed widget.

While in development mode (`yarn dev`) the script will rebuild on any changes to files in the `src` directory. Ensure that the required keys for the development embed are accurate and set.

`yarn build` will compile and minify your build of the script. You can then host and link your built script wherever you like.

## Integrations & Embed Types

### `<script>` tag HTML embed

The primary way of embedding a workspace as a chat widget is via a simple `<script>`

```html
<!--
An example of a script tag embed
REQUIRED data attributes:
  data-embed-id // The unique id of your embed with its default settings
  data-base-api-url // The URL of your anythingLLM instance backend
-->
<script
  data-embed-id="5fc05aaf-2f2c-4c84-87a3-367a4692c1ee"
  data-base-api-url="http://localhost:3001/api/embed"
  src="http://localhost:3000/embed/anythingllm-chat-widget.min.js"
></script>
```

Defaults to "false".

- `data-support-email` â€” Shows a support email that the user can used to draft an email via the "three dot" menu in the top right. Option will not appear if it is not set.

### Pub/Sub Events

The AnythingLLM embed supports a series of events that you can subscribe to for advanced customization and integration. These events allow you to hook into key points in the chat experience.

You can handle these events by defining your event handler functions and attaching them via script attributes:

```html
<!-- First, define your event handler functions -->
<script>
  // Handler for when the chat window fully loads
  function onChatWindowLoaded(event) {
    console.log("Chat window loaded with settings:", event.detail.settings);
    console.log("Session ID:", event.detail.sessionId);
    console.log("Initial chat history:", event.detail.chatHistory);
  }

  // Handler to intercept and modify chat responses before they're displayed
  function onChatResponseReceived(event) {
    // Access the original data
    const originalResponse = event.detail.originalChatResult;

    // Modify the response if needed
    if (originalResponse.textResponse) {
      // Add a custom prefix to all assistant messages
      event.detail.modifiedChatResult.textResponse =
        "ðŸ¤– " + originalResponse.textResponse;
    }
  }

  // Handler for when a complete chat response has finished
  function onChatResponseCompleted(event) {
    console.log("Chat response completed with type:", event.detail.type);
    console.log("Full chat history:", event.detail.history);

    // You can perform analytics, save data, or trigger UI updates
  }

  // Handler to intercept and modify user messages before sending to the API
  function onBeforeSendMessage(event) {
    console.log("Original message:", event.detail.originalMessage);

    // Modify the message before it's sent
    event.detail.modifiedMessage = event.detail.originalMessage.trim();

    // Optionally cancel sending this message
    if (event.detail.modifiedMessage.includes("forbidden_term")) {
      event.detail.cancel = true;
      alert("Message contains prohibited content");
    }
  }
</script>

<!-- Then, attach your handlers to the embed script using data-xxx-event attributes -->
<script
  data-embed-id="5fc05aaf-2f2c-4c84-87a3-367a4692c1ee"
  data-base-api-url="http://localhost:3001/api/embed"
  data-chat-window-loaded-event="onChatWindowLoaded"
  data-chat-response-received-event="onChatResponseReceived"
  data-chat-response-completed-event="onChatResponseCompleted"
  data-before-send-message-event="onBeforeSendMessage"
  src="http://localhost:3000/embed/anythingllm-chat-widget.min.js"
></script>
```
